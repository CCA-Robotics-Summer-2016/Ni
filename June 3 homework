Thoughts:
- be careful with details in coding, watch for ; location
- 

Question:
-1) if the arduino is connected to a 9v battery, is another one still needed for the motor ?(connected to pin 8 on the H bridge)
-2) when trying to do a gradual speed increase/decrease, the motor starts with a high pitch hum with no motion. 
-3) when using an incremental increase in motor speed controlled by a light sensor as switch, it seems the motor won't stop when "switch" is off unless its speed is reduced to 0.
